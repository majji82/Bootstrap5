Sometimes images are bigger than the screen..So we can use a class called img-fluid to set it to window size.

The img-fluid will impact only the images which are bigger than the screen size and adjusts accordingly..
If we need a small border around the image and also the image is a bit curved at borders we can use "image-thumbnail"

If we want the image to be at the left and the text must be beside it..then add float-start to the image, and if we want the image to at right use float-end

If we want the image to be at the center use: d-block, mx-auto...
To control border-radius use rounded...

img-fluid
img-thumbnail
mb-4
float-start 
d-block, mx-auto
rounded-1 to rounded-5
