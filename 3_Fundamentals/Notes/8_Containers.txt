Whenever we write text in paragraph or we store that paragraph in a div..It occupies the complete screen..But we generally don't want it to occupy the complete screen and sometimes we need it to be in center..

So bootstrap has an inbuilt class called container which we can use to align the text at center and also set the padding and margin in a correct way..

Note: 
If we use it we also don't have to worry about the viewport breakpoints..It will automatically be responsive..

Default:

for xxl => >1400px => width: 1320px
for xl  => >1200px => width: 1140px
for lg  => >992px  => width: 960px
for md  => >768px  => width: 720px
for sm  => >576px  => width: 540px

fluid:

Now as we see for different breakpoints, it takes different width and aligns the container to the center. But to make it take the complete screen use fluid..

<div class="container-fluid"></div>

If we need to take the container full screen after a certain breakpoint use the breakpoint class after the container

<div class="container-xl"></div>
