What is gutter?

Gutter is the default padding that comes with the columns which is approx 1.5rem (24px) wide..

We can also change the default gutter size using gx...where it changes the padding left and right [x-axis, horizontal] gy => y axis changes top and bottom..
It ranges from gx-1 to gx-5 [4px - 24px]

Note: if we give gutter value 0 => then there will be no space between them..

If we need equal gutter in both x and y axis then we can just use g-2 (any number)
