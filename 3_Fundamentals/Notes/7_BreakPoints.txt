Breakpoints:

Whenever we work with normal CSS to make a website responsive we use media queries and write code accordingly...
In bootstrap we no longer need to write media queries as they are pre-defined and using bootstrap itself make the website responsive...

But sometimes we need to adjust specific components for optimal display.  However, we no need to specify the code..There are inbuilt classes designed for specific screen sizes...
