To create a grid using bootstrap we have inbuilt classes.. we have to use container, row and col..

inside the container place the row,and inside the row place as many columns as you need..

Control the sizing of each column:

=> If we place multiple columns, then by default bootstrap gives equal space to all the columns and make them center aligned as they are present in a container...
    But if we need to distribute the space unequally among the columns then we have to specify a specific number beside the columns..

How?

=> By default all the columns combined together get the number 12. so divide the number accordingly for all columns such that they add up to 12.

Ex: <div class="col-2"> and <div class="col-10"> both add up to 12 and one gets 16% and other gets 84%..

We can also use the breakpoint classes..to make them stack over each other..

What if we give number to some of the cols? => rest will divide remaining area equally

If we have all the numbers less than 12, it will leave some free space towards right..If we need to align then center just use justify-content-center in row..

We can also specify how many columns we need in a row by using row-cols-2(number)

For no of columns for specific breakpoints:
<div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-lg-2">

row-cols-1: For extra small and small screens.
row-cols-md-2: For medium screens and above (e.g., tablets).
row-cols-lg-2: For large screens and above (e.g., desktops).


We can also nest them accordingly...
