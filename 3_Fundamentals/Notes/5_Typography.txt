For headings we have classes with h1 to h6.

ex: <h1 class="h1">This is a Heading</h1>
Use Case:
According to SEO rules we cannot use more than one h1..But we can use p tag as h1 by using class=h1  

For text to appear a bit grey use: class="text-muted"
for text to be center aligned use: class="text-center"
for text to be right aligned use: class="text-end"
for text to be left aligned use: class="text-start"

There is also display-1 to display-6 and also lead attributes for bootstrap classes..
