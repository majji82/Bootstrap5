Vertical Alignment:

If the height of the row is greater than the height of the columns present then we can adjust the columns vertically in the middle or top or bottom..

Syntax:

align-items-start
align-items-center
align-items-end

These three classes are used in a row to align all the columns either to top/bottom/center..

align-self-start
align-self-center
align-self-end

These three classes are used to a particular column to align that particular column..

Horizontal Alignment:

If there is more space to the right by default then we can horizontally align them by using justify content...

Syntax:

justify-content-start
justify-content-center
justify-content-end

Note: Always the addition of col must be 12

Reordering of columns:

We can reorder the columns using classes like:

order-first
order-last 
and also numbers like order-1, order-2, order-3

This order is used when we need to show the items differently in different view ports..
